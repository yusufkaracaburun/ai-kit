# Changelog

## 1.0.0 — 2026-05-23

Initial release after version-history reset. Prior tags (v1.0.0–v5.0.2)
were deleted from origin on 2026-05-23 to consolidate the rapid pre-1.0
churn that accumulated during the May 2026 primitive-expansion + plugin
distribution work. Git history of `master` is preserved — only version
tags + this CHANGELOG were reset.

Current shipping surface at v1.0.0:

- 23 skills (workflow/skills/)
- 3 subagents (workflow/agents/)
- 7 slash commands (workflow/commands/)
- Self-contained Claude Code plugin distribution (workflow/bin/, workflow/hooks/)
- Cursor + Claude Code rule emitters (bin/lib/emitters/{cursor,claude-code,generic}.sh)
- 387-test regression suite
